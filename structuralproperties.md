# Structural Properties
For the treatment of constrained mechanical Systems, its structural properties derived from the Equations of Motion are very important. In this section we will focus on the smplecticness of the flow generated by the Equations of Motions derived from the Livens Principle:

$$
\dot{q}=v, 
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 
            \dot{p},
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial v} = p
$$

## Conservation of Energy
The first important property is the conservation of energy in the system.
We know the energy function of a mechanical sytsem is given as

$$
E(q,v,p) = p\cdot{v} - L(q,v)
$$

To asses the change of energy in the system we take the derivative with respect to time

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = \dot{p}\cdot{v} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}\cdot{\dot{q}} + (p - \frac{\partial L}{\partial v})\cdot{\dot{v}}
$$

and when taking into account the Euler-Lagrange equations we get $\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = 0$, which means that the energy in the system is conserved.

## Symplecticness of Flow
Now we want to check if the flow generated by the Equations of motions is symplectic.
We therefore take the derivative of the wedge product with respect to time

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(dq \land dp) = \sum_{i=1}^{d}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}[dp_idq_i - dq_idp_i] = (d\dot{q} \land dp) + (dq \land d\dot{p})
$$

If we now make use of our equations and use the properties of the wedgeproduct get

$
d\dot{q} = dv\\
$

$
d\dot{p} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q \partial q} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q \partial v}\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} dq\\ dv \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q \partial q}dq + \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q \partial v}dv
$

$
dp = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial v \partial q} & \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial v \partial v}\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} dq\\ dv \end{pmatrix} = \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial v \partial q}dq + \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial v \partial v}dv
$

Furthermore the matrices $\frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q \partial q}, \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q \partial v}, \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial v \partial q}, \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial v \partial v}$ are symmetric which leads us to

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(dq \land dp) = dv \land \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial v \partial q}dq + dv \land \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial v \partial v}dv + dq \land \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q \partial q}dq + dq \land \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q \partial v}dv
$$

The second and the thrid term vanish and we get

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}(dq \land dp) = \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial v \partial q}dv \land dq - \frac{\partial^2 L}{\partial q \partial v}dv \land dq = 0
$$

We now see that the flow of motion is smplectic which motivates the following definition of a symplectic procedure

For a fixed step size $h$ and a procedure $\psi_h: \mathbb{R}^{2d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2d}: (q_n, p_n) \mapsto (q_{n+1}, p_{n+1})$
is symplectic if the map $\psi_h$ is symplectic.
