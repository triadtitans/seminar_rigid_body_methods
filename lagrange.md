# Lagrangian mechanics

## An introduction to langrangian mechanics

There is now a way to move a body. However, this motion shall follow the laws of physics.
The approach of this project was to use langrangian mechanics.

As opposed to newtonian mechanics, lagrangian mechanics allow for so-called generalized coordinates.
