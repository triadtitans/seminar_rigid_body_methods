# Structural Properties
For the treatment of constrained mechanical Systems, its structural properties derived from the Equations of Motion are very important. In this section we will focus on the smplecticness of the flow generated by the Equations of Motions derived from the Livens Principle:

$$
\dot{q}=v, 
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 
            \dot{p},
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial v} = p
$$

## Conservation of Energy
The first important property is the conservation of energy in the system.
We know the energy function of a mechanical sytsem is given as

$$
E(q,v,p) = p\cdot{v} - L(q,v)
$$

To asses the change of energy in the system we take the derivative with respect to time

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = \dot{p}\cdot{v} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}\cdot{\dot{q}} + (p - \frac{\partial L}{\partial v})\cdot{\dot{v}}
$$

and when taking into account the Euler-Lagrange equations we get $\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = 0$, which means that the energy in the system is conserved.
