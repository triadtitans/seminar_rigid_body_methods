# Structural Properties
For the treatment of constrained mechanical Systems, its structural properties derived from the Equations of Motion are very important. In this section we will focus on the smplecticness of the flow generated by the Equations of Motions derived from the Livens Principle:

$$
\dot{q}=v \\
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 
            \dot{p} \\
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial v} = q \\
$$
