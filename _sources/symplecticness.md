# Symplecticness
In this chapter we focus on the important property of symplecticness of maps.
At first a general definition of symplecticness of smooth maps is given, followed by a geometric interpretation and a description of its importance to mechanical systems.

## Symplecticness of smooth mappings
Symplecticness deals with bilinear, skew-symmetric maps acting on vectorspaces
A linear map $\L: \mathbb{R}^{2d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ is called symplectic with regard to the structure matrix $J$ if 

$$
L^{T}JL = J 
$$

A differential map $\varphi: \mathbb{R}^{2d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ is called symplectic with regard to the structure matrix $J$ if the jacobian Matrix $g'(p,g)$ is symplectic

$$
g'(p,g)^{T}Jg'(p,g)
$$
