# Symplecticness
In this chapter we focus on the important property of symplecticness of maps.
At first a general definition of symplecticness of smooth maps is given, followed by a geometric interpretation and a description of its importance to mechanical systems.

## Symplecticness of smooth mappings
A linear mapping $L: \mathbb{R}^{2d} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ is called symplectic with regard to the structure Matrix $J$ if

$$
A^{T}JA = J 
$$
