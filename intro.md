This seminar paper deals with the simulation of rigid bodies.
The main part of the corresponding seminar was the development of rigid body simulation framework ASC-ODE.
The latter implements lagrangian mechanics and an ODE solver as well as a novel algorithm based on the Discontinuous galerkin method.
