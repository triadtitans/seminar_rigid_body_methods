<!---
This seminar paper deals with the simulation of rigid bodies.
The main part of the corresponding seminar was the development of rigid body simulation framework ASC-ODE.
The latter implements lagrangian mechanics and an ODE solver as well as a novel algorithm based on the Discontinuous galerkin method.
--->

In computational chemistry and other domains of science, so-called rigid-body simulations are used.
These permit the physically accurate prediction of body motions.
The aim of this seminar project was to implement a simulation algorithm and analyse it.
This website documents the process.
